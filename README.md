This is an ecommerce website built with Django and React, styled with SemanticUI, and backed with a REST API and Stripe payments.
The site is deployed via Heroku at: https://tea-ware.herokuapp.com.

I wrote the site to practice the Django/React stack.

It turns out one of the bigger challenges was getting it deployed to Heroku.
_Lesson Learned:_ implement the deployment process as early as possible!
